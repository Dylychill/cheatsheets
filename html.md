# HTML
### Syntax
```html
<div class="className"> <!-- Open and closing tags -->
    hello
</div>
```

Tags can have attributes inside the `<>` usually set with an `=`.

Some key attributes are:
- `class`: creates a CSS selector to access element
- `onChange`: sets rules for when a change occurs
- `value`: value of an input

### Elements
`<div>`: no semantic meaning, standard box

`<img>`: self closing, has a src and alt attribute

`header`, `footer`, `main`: some semantic tags, mainly for establishing hierarchy

`<a href="[link]">text</a>`: a tag is a link with attribute href which is the link itself. In between the >< is the text that appears on the page.

`button`, `input`: has some inherent styling, used for user input
